			<span>I always studied in Porto, on the 10 year I frequented the Science and Technology course. Right now I am studying computer engineer at <acronym title="Superior Institute of Engineering of Porto">ISEP</acronym> (More Info Below). I started learning Java in 2012 but I was always very curious with everything that was computer related. Also in that year I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript on my own. After that I learned Assembly, C and C++ in university. I always try to learn something new when Im not on classes. You can see a full description of my skills <a onclick="activateProfessionalArea();">here</a>.</span>

				My passion with computers developed with an early age, ever since my first experience with a computer I wondered how the different applications, websites and games were built. I started programming HTML with the Hi5 social platform (Hi5 let you customize your profile with HTML and CSS) and I didn't even knew what it was. Later when I started to learn Java my passion with programming grew even more, and I started learning another languages on my own, in sites such as Codecademy, or by watching Youtube tutorials. As I started to understand how computers and computer programs work, I started to develop a interest in hacking, I thinks its very interesting how people find security holes in the most secure programs. I have always the need to do other projects aside from university work, but don't have much time as I have to study. I later noticed that all my projects were coming out ugly, so I started studying Design on my own and developed a passion for it, I believe that aside from a program being pratical, it has to have a nice interface that the user can understand easily.

			<h1>Cycling</h1>
			<span>I love to ride my bicycle, altough I don't have this hobbie for a long time (I bought my bicycle on 2015 spring), it didn't pass too much time till I fell in love with it. I tend to go anywhere I can riding bicycle, as it's a sport where at the same time I'm going to a place I'm working out. This makes trips shorter and more enjoyable.

			<h1>Gaming</h1>
			<span>One of my biggest hobbies is playing computer games, not only because is fun, but because I always wanted to program a game, and by playing it and watching the behind the scenes videos and interviews with the developers you get to see how much work is envolved in the making of a game. It also develops creativity. I like to take games as a competition, where I have to unlock everything.</span>

			<h1>Music</h1>

Music is a huge help when I program because it prevents my brain from freezing, and it helps to keep me motivated. My favorite genre of music is Rock. Some of the bands I like are Royal Blood, Xutos e Pontapes and 3 Doors Down. My favorite band is the Foo Fighters.</span>

				I love programming and everything that is technology related. I like problems that are hard to solve, and that take a lot of time and headaches. Some of my hobbies are playing videogames and riding bicycle. I started programming in 2012 but I always wanted to create things with a computer, especially videogames.
